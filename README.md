### What you will learn
- Study Deep RL both in theory and practice  
- Master famous libraries: **Stable Baselines3**, RL Baselines3 Zoo, CleanRL, Sample Factory, SB3-Contrib  
- Train agents in unique environments: Huggy the Doggo, SnowballFight, VizDoom, Space Invaders, PyBullet, MuJoCo and more  
- Push your trained models to the Hugging Face Hub with a single line of code  
- (Used to) Participate in leaderboards and AI-vs-AI challenges  
- Earn a free certificate (Completion ≥80 % | Honors 100 %)

### Current Status (2025 – Low-Maintenance Mode)
The course is still an **excellent and complete resource** for learning Deep RL, but please note:

| Feature                  | Status                                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Units 1–6, 8–9           | Fully functional (theory + hands-on notebooks) |
| Unit 7 (AI vs AI soccer) | Currently non-functional (you can still train and watch your agent) |
| Leaderboard              | No longer operational                           |
| Certificates             | Still automatically issued when you reach 80 % / 100 % of assignments |
| Discord community        | Active and helpful                              |

If you encounter bugs in the notebooks, check the GitHub issues or ask in Discord — the community usually have solutions.

### Tools you need (all free)
1. A computer + internet  
2. Google Colab (free tier is more than enough)  
3. A Hugging Face account → https://huggingface.co/join  

### Recommended installation (one-liner for macOS / Linux / Colab / Windows)
```bash
pip install "stable-baselines3[extra]" sb3-contrib "gymnasium[all]" shimmy[all] huggingface-sb3 huggingface_hub imageio-ffmpeg moviepy tensorboard rich tqdm
```

(macOS users: if Box2D fails → `brew install swig openmp` first)

### Course structure
- Theory sections  
- Hands-on Google Colab notebooks (with video companions)  
- Quizzes & assignments (required for certificate)  
- (Old) Challenges & leaderboards

### Certification (completely free & self-paced)
- ≥ 80 % of assignments → Certificate of Completion  
- 100 % of assignments → Certificate of Honors  
No deadlines — go at your own pace!

### How to get the most out of the course
1. Join the Discord → https://discord.gg/huggingface (channel #rl-discussions)  
2. Form or join study groups  
3. Do all quizzes and assignments  
4. Follow the suggested 1-unit-per-week rhythm (3–4 h/week)

### Authors & Team
- Thomas Simonini – Founder of the course, Deep RL specialist @ Hugging Face  
- Omar Sanseviero – ML Engineer @ Hugging Face (llamas)  
- Sayak Paul – Developer Advocate @ Hugging Face (crime thrillers)
